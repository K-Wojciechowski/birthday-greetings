Birthday Greetings
==================

A simple app to send birthday greetings to people on their birthdays.

Features
--------

* Support for CSV and SQLite data sources
* Support for multiple ways of sending messages (currently simulates e-mail and SMS)
* Extensibility â€” modular design

CLI usage
---------

1. Edit `birthday_greetings/settings.py` to choose your reader and sender backends.
2. If you intend to use the SQLite backend, create the database first: `sqlite3 db.sqlite3 < sample.sql`
3. Run `python -m birthday_greetings` to use the CLI.

You can install in a venv with `pip install -e .` if you want (it will create a `birthday_greetings` command).

Tests
-----

Run `python -m unittest` to run the test suite.

Dependencies
------------

Runtime: Python 3.7+ with no external dependencies (or 3.6 with a `dataclasses` backport)

Development (optional): black, isort (code style); mypy (type checking) coverage (code coverage). Run `make` to reformat code, check types and run tests with coverage.
